# Setting up mdx runtime on Webpack 5

I was running into some problems when trying to run
@mdx-js/runtime on Next.js

I needed to configure next.config.js to ignore fs module

    module.exports = {
      reactStrictMode: true,
      webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
        if (!isServer) {
          config.resolve.fallback = {
            ...config.resolve.fallback,
            fs: false,
          };
        }
        return config;
      },
    };
